# Squid's Quiz-Game

# Description
It's a game in which you are quizzed. You have 75 seconds to answer 5 of the hardest questions I can think of.

# Features

## Home Page

Simple as can be but still fucntional. From here you can start the game or look at high scores.

## During the game

Score is based off of how many questions you get right. All of the questions probably take an actual genuis to solve. They're crazy hard. I mean really don't feel bad if you don't get the answer right. Ninety percent of people don't...

Really it's no biggie
